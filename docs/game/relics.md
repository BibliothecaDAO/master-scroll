# Relics

> There are 8000 ancient Relics across the Realmverse and one exists on each Realm. You must defend your Realm or your Relic will be stolen.

### What are Relics?

Each Realm has a unique Relic which it must protect. The people of your Realm worship this Relic and if it is lost they start to lose hope in your leadership.

### How do you capture a Relic?

You can plunder a Relic by Raiding another Realm, which you’ll receive along with the Resources of a successful Raid. 

Once you have plundered a Relic, it will exist on your attacking Realm until the Relic owner successfully Raids you back - adding an incentive for retaliation. 

Losing your Relic affects your happiness rating by -20 points, which will impact your daily resource harvest yield. 

It would be wise to build a strong defensive squad to protect your valuable Relic.
