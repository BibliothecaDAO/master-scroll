## Origin

The 8000 Realms were procedurally generated as black and white SVG files, but have since then begun their transition into high-fidelity 3D renders using height maps.

 ## 22 Resources

Every Realm contains at least one (up to 7) of the 22 different resources discovered thus far in the Lootverse, each with their varying rarity.

## 4 Traits

Each Realm has a unique number of geographical traits: 
- Cities (max 21) 
- Regions (max 7)
- Harbors (max 35)
- Rivers (max 60)

These traits play a vital role in constraining what can be built on each Realm. 

**Cities** x **Regions** + 25 = the amount of spatial area the Realm can build on (military buildings, workers huts, store houses etc).

**Harbors** = the number of Fishing Traps that can be built.

**Rivers** = the number of Farms that can be built.
