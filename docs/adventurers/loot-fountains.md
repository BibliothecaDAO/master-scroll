# Inflation: Loot Fountains

💡 Layer 1 = Data Layer

💡 Layer 2 = Computation

For Loot to realize its potential as a high-value game asset it needs to be more dynamic and available to more people. We have taken the approach of an inflationary distillation contract which splits each Loot bag into its individual items. Each item is then available on StarkNet to trade and play with. Balance this contract with controlled inflation mechanics and we can open Loot to the next 100k players.

### Controlled inflation is good

Inflation is a natural phenomenon in the world as more energy is injected into ecosystems. Loot is no different. There are 8000 Loot bags with a total of 64000 items.

This process would look something like this:

### Item Flow

1. Items are distilled into individual ERC721s directly onto StarkNet in the holder's account
2. Items are available to trade, use in games, or equip on Adventurer

### Inflation Rate

The actual inflation rate will be finalized on a vote by the hybrid DAO, however, our proposal is as follows:

- 1 Distil event per 604800s (1 Week)
- 25 $LORDS to Distil a Bag

If 2000 bags are distilled each week, this will equate to ~16,000 items which allow the equipping of potentially 2000 Adventurers. Although it is highly doubtful that all 2000 would be assembled.

### Item Statistics

Each item will have its own set of dynamic statistics that will evolve with usage.

### Equipping Items

Adventurers will be able to equip these items in any combination they see suits them best.

### Trading

All the Loot items will be traded on the NFT Marketplace and will be priced in $LORDS.

### Dropping of Items

In the Lootverse there will be various places to explore. Some of these places will be more dangerous than others. If a traveller is not careful they may drop their items and never recover them...

### The Merchant Contract

A merchant will be a buy-back contract where users can go to burn their unwanted items. In exchange for the burn, the players will receive a combination of resources and or Lords back. This will aim to provide a lever to control the supply of items into the marketplace. The specifics of this will be explained closer to launch.

### Governance

This contract will be governed by a hybrid DAO of multiple projects not only Realm holders. This will ensure that this contract is a public good contract.
